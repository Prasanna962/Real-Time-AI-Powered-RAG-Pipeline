# Real-Time-AI-Powered-RAG-Pipeline
🚀 Automatic RAG Pipeline Using AWS (POC)
Ever wanted a smart search system that retrieves information like ChatGPT but with your own private data? That’s exactly what this project does! It’s an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that processes and retrieves information in real-time using AWS, Zilliz, and OpenAI.

📅 Timeline: Sep 2023 – Dec 2023
⚡ Tech Stack: Python, AWS (Lambda, S3, SageMaker), Zilliz, OpenAI, AI/ML Libraries

🌟 What This Project Does
1️⃣ Automatically Picks Up Files from Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda (No manual uploads!)
2️⃣ Cleans & Prepares Data using AI/ML in SageMaker (Breaks it down into smart chunks)
3️⃣ Stores Data as Vectors in Zilliz Vector Database for super-fast AI-powered searches
4️⃣ Retrieves the Right Information in SageMaker using advanced similarity-based search

Simply put, it turns raw data into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base!

🔹 Why This is Cool
✅ No more manually searching through files – just type a query, and AI finds the answer
✅ Super-fast and accurate search using AI-driven embeddings
✅ Fully automated workflow – from file upload to retrieval
✅ Scalable & efficient – can handle large datasets with ease

📌 How to Use This Project?
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Pipeline
Deploy Lambda functions to automate file processing
Use SageMaker notebooks to preprocess and retrieve data
Search for relevant information using Zilliz Vector Database
